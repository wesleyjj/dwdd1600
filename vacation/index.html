        <p>Budget Vacations was founded by lovers of vacations, who happen to be particularly knowledgeable about cruising and Disney Destinations.  But it's not just the destinations we treasure.  We value The Experience.  The Time.  The Quality.  We're not just going to "see the world" - we're going to see each other.  To be unplugged, as it were, from everything in our daily lives that keeps us from relaxing and fully enjoying each other's company.</p>
        <p>That's what we want to do for you and your family.  Our motto at Budget Vacations is: "there is no such thing as a staycation"; and although you certainly CAN (and SHOULD) find ways at home to regularly connect with family and friends, you have to GO somewhere - ANYWHERE - to truly disconnect from Normal, and truly call it a Vacation.</p>
        <p>At Budget Vacations, we rely on personalized customer service and attention to detail to make your family’s dream vacation a reality.  Our agents are uniquely qualified to guide you through the best vacation options for your family, whether you're a multi-kid, multi-generation family, a couple of empty nesters, planning a honeymoon, or a group of friends looking to get away.</p>
        <p>Planning vacations can be overwhelming.  Policies & procedures, resort choices, park passes, port excursions, dining reservations and more - let our experienced agents help you navigate the maze of details before you. By the time you leave home, you will be confident that you have all the information you need to make the most of your family’s time together.</p>
